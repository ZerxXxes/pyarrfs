Version 0.6.0 (2011-01-07)
--------------------------
Command line option parsing implemented somewhat. Logging configuration is
improved by the integration with command line options and the root dir can be
set, although it so far has no effect ;)

Version 0.5.0 (2011-01-07)
--------------------------
First version released, previous to this, pyarrfs was only available via git
The thing is basically working but has a few rough edges which will be worked
out before releasing 1.0
